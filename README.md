# octra web client (NOT official)

**NOTE**: This is **NOT** an official client.

This is a simple web client for [Octra](https://octra.org/), made for users who are having difficulty with the **OFFICIAL** [TUI (text-based user interface) client](https://github.com/octra-labs/octra_pre_client).

## Usage

If you don't have an Octra wallet yet, you can generate one using the official wallet generator at [here](https://github.com/octra-labs/wallet-gen).

Then use the deployed client here.

Or, you can start your own development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Or, you can deploy it directly to Vercel:


## TODO
- [ ] support multi send
- [ ] support staging transaction history
- [ ] support transaction history pagination
- [ ] maybe support wallet generation?
